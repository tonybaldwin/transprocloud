TransProCloud - Installation

This is all very preliminary.
TransProCloud requires a LAMP server.

Clone the git repository to where you want the app.
Create a mysql database.
Enter the dbuser, dbname, dbpass, dbhost, and site_url
into admin.
run admin/maketables.php from the cli
/usr/bin/php ../admin/maketables.php

BEWARE:
This is not even alpha, yet.
This code is not complete.
When this code is actually a stable release, 
this BEWARE message will be removed from this file.
